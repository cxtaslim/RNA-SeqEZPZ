Running differential analysis with hg19 as reference. 

Options used to run:
padj=0.05
time=7-00:00:00
genome=hg19
batch_adjust=yes

all outputs will be stored in /gpfs0/home2/gdtheisenlab/cxt050/Steve/virtual_server/rnaseq-singularity/project_ex/outputs
See /gpfs0/home2/gdtheisenlab/cxt050/Steve/virtual_server/rnaseq-singularity/project_ex/run_differential_analysis_rna.out to check the analysis progress
All other logs and scripts ran will be stored in /gpfs0/home2/gdtheisenlab/cxt050/Steve/virtual_server/rnaseq-singularity/project_ex/outputs/logs
