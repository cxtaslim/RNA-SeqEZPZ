Running full RNA-seq analysis

Options used to run:
padj=0.05
time=7-00:00:00
genome=hg19
batch_adjust=yes
ncpus_trim=4


Using singularity image and scripts in: /gpfs0/home2/gdtheisenlab/cxt050/Steve/virtual_server/rnaseq-singularity 

All outputs will be stored in /gpfs0/home2/gdtheisenlab/cxt050/Steve/virtual_server/rnaseq-singularity/project_ex/outputs

Logs and scripts ran will be stored in /gpfs0/home2/gdtheisenlab/cxt050/Steve/virtual_server/rnaseq-singularity/project_ex/outputs/logs


Check and generate STAR index if genome has not been indexed yet....

Done checking and generating STAR index as needed.
See run_star_index.out for more details.
