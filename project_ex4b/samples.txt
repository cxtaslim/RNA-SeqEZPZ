# Do NOT put empty line between this comments and your samples information
# All data must be stored in one ""project"" directory with a sub-directory called ""fastq"".
# You can have sub-directories within your fastq directory
# Controlname column contains the control/background file for that particular sample.
# In this example, control for iEF714 is iEF197. Controlname must be one of Groupname
# Please put NA as Controlname for the control file.
# Groupname and Controlname must be part of filename.
# Replicatename must be part of filename. Replicatename cannot be empty.
# Even if you only have 1 replicate, please put rep1 as Replicatename,
# then change your filenames accordingly.
# spikename must be all NA.
# Under email column, change all NAs to your email address to get email notification of jobs run.
# string_to_identify_group is a string that distinguish the file names of one group versus another
# In project_ex, the file names for iEF714 replicate 1 all contains the string "iEF714R1".
# Therefore, string_to_identify_group is iEF714R1.
# For paired reads, each fastq file will have pair of file with exactly the same name except for _R1_
# and _R2_ which means read pair1 and pair2, respectively. Therefore, string_pair1 is _R1_ and
# string_pair2 is _R2_. Usually this doesn't need to be changed!
# This (samplex.txt) file needs to be inside your project directory
