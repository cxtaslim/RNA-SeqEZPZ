# Do NOT put empty line between this comments and your samples information
# All data must be stored in one ""project"" directory with a sub-directory called ""fastq"".
# You can have sub-directories within your fastq directory
# Controlname column contains the control/background file for that particular sample.
# In this example, control for 714 is 197. Controlname must be one of Groupname
# Please put NA as Controlname for the control file
# Groupname and Controlname must be part of filename
# Replicatename must be part of filename. Replicatename cannot be empty. Even if you only have 1 replicate, please put rep1 as Replicatename
# spikename must be all NA
# string_to_identify_group is a string that distinguish the file names of one group versus another
# In project_ex, the directory and file names for 714 replicate 1 all contains the string ""714R1
# Therefore, string_to_identify_group is 714R1
# For paired reads, each fastq file will have pair of file with exactly the same name except for _R1_
# and _R2_ which means pair1 and pair2. Therefore, string_pair1 is _R1_ and
# string_pair2 is _R2_. Usually this doens't need to be changed!
# This file needs to be inside the project directory
